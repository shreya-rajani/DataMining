Write a Python module to apply 10-fold cross-validation evaluation to the Titanic data set
available in Week 6 of the Modules page on Canvas. Compare the accuracy of your zeroR.py to the
sklearn implementation of DecisionTreeClassifier (using all the default settings for the latter). To
help you out, I have posted a regular Python version of the summary of supervised learning that you
worked on in class (also in Week 6 of the Modules). Turn in your code and a copy of its output, which
should simply print the name of the classifier and the accuracy.
